# Vision Transformer
This is the implementation of the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). 
Thanks to [Brian Pulfer](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/vision-transformers-from-scratch-pytorch-a-step-by-step-guide-96c3313c2e0c) and his medium article on the topic, they were extremely helpful and a valuable resource.

More comments will be added in the future to make the process of understanding the code easier.

I have used the MNIST dataset for this code.
